- current goals
  - get a basic comparison with the job ryan gave me
    - then, get it working with a smaller population
      - then, get this to alecksey and see what he thinks
    - also run it with different compressors
  - check out what it's like with a smaller population -- does it compress better than randomly-generated data, as expected?

- jobs on blade_11 trying the big job ryan suggested
- will using a small compression give us acceptibly compressed data?
- run it on windows (https://datastax.jira.com/browse/ITINF-45)
